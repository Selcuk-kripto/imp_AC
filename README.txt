The code "crypt_prop.cpp" finds cryptographic properties (nonlinearity, absolute indicator, algebraic degree, balancedness) 
of the Boolean functions given in Table 1 of the paper "Improved autocorrelation properties of balanced Boolean functions 
on even number of variables" by Selçuk Kavut, Hakan Kutucu, Erol Özçekiç. 
The code is compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ 2010.

The following files (available in "tts.rar") are needed to run the code.
